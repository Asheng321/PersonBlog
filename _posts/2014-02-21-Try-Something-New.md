I have used PHP to create many websites, now it is time to try new technologies for me: Java Web with angularJS.      


For my last course project, we will create a web app which is called Abuse Reporting System. For this project, I choose [JFnial](https://github.com/jfinal/jfinal) as my Java Web MVC framework, as we don't have too much time to do the implementation, and we have some guys who are good at coding in our team, to make they can learn something, I give up using Spring. For front-end, we will use AngularJS, which is from Google.   

As a whole, we will make a REST service, which render JSON format data to front end, then we use AngularJS to parse it and display the data to users.    

The project location is: [https://github.com/zhouhao/Abuse-Reporting-System](https://github.com/zhouhao/Abuse-Reporting-System)[Currently, it only returns a "hello word" JSON data]
