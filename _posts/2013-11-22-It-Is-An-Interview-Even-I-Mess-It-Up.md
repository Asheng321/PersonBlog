Interview always makes me nervous, especially phone interview.    

Today, I got an interview from the west of US.       

My stupid assumption, I thought Friday will be more quiet than other days, as everyone will prepare for their weekend. But I am wrong. I was taking my interview aside the door, but as people went around, the door made great noise, so I went out to continue.     

Seems everything is not so bad. Then my intervewer asked me to pick up a pen with paper. Haha, I wen inside to find my bag! Oh, nooooooo~ I found this sticker there. Can thing be worse?

OK, thanks to the interviewer, instead of doing some writing, she kept asking me question.   

`- End -`     

Conclusion:
---
1. Never never make stupid assumption, just find a quiet place instead.   
2. Pratice more speaking    
3. Smile is great, I say the smile from interviewer.   
4. Do not make your words so professional.   
5. Do some preparation, and do not use your time to code always
