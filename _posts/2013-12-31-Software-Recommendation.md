###Text Editor:
1. [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3): Now, installing Sublime text 3 is the first thing I do when I refresh my OS, no matter WINDOWS, Ubuntu or Mac.    
2. [EverEdit](http://www.everedit.net/): another choice for WINDOWS, but only for WINDOWS.     
3. [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/): A markdown editor for WINDOWS, not free. But I have bought a license.      
4. [Mou](http://mouapp.com/): A markdown editor for Mac, and free.
