###Text Editor:
1. [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3): Now, installing Sublime text 3 is the first thing I do when I refresh my OS, no matter WINDOWS, Ubuntu or Mac.    
2. [EverEdit](http://www.everedit.net/): another choice for WINDOWS, but only for WINDOWS.     
3. [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/): A markdown editor for WINDOWS, not free. But I have bought a license.      
4. [Mou](http://mouapp.com/): A markdown editor for Mac, and free.    

###FTP & SFTP
1. [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/docs/introduction): For WINDOWS only. It is very powerful, as it is integrated with [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) SSH client (WinSCP + PuTTY + Sublime Text = My choices in WINDOWS).    
2. [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/): For WINDOWS & Mac. I use it on my air with [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home).      
3. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/): For ALL platform, but I only use it on Ubuntu.     
[**Note**: All of them support Key Authentication!]
