Recently, I am doing project related to Hadoop. And I just know compile the source in terminal and package it into a jar. But, it is annoying when I do this again and again, as I must input two commands: one for `class`, one for `jar`. What's more, when I do this in terminal, I have no idea to how compile two source files, so for a compromise, I put all the classes into one source file, which is not friendly to read.    

Yesterday, with the help from my friend, Jialiang, I finally can get my `jar` from Eclipse with just some mouse clicks. And it is very easy to configure Hadoop into Eclipse. So, just follow the instructions below:

![Step 3](/images/blog/hadoopInEclipse/3.png "Step 3")     
![Step 4](/images/blog/hadoopInEclipse/4.png "Step 4")      

Now, enjoy this and have fun!
