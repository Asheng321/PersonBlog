>Why you need to catch a cold?   

I don't know, maybe you need to get some sympathy from others for some stupid reasons. maybe catching a cold will give you a reason to sleep a whole day without coding without feeling guilty.  

>I wish you can find your reason, so that we can take the following step.  

Actually, the next step is very easy, as it is cold outside during the night. So, the next step is **to keep your windows open** before sleep. (Yeah, I succeed in this this way.) 

>Congratulation!!! You catch a cold now!!! 

Damn! The feeling is not so good!!! ---- But no regrat now, as it is too late.

###OK, it is time to tell you how & why I catch a cold.
1. I bought a bottle of orange juice from super market.     
2. I wanted to keep it cold, but I am "lazy", as I don't want to store it in the refrigerator    
3. The best way I came up with is to put it aside the window (it is just nearby my bed), as I know it is cold during the night(see the picture below).

4. "Thanks to" the whole night, I caught a cold at last.     
5. But I hate this feeling, really hate it.
