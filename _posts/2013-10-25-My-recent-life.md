The fall term break will soon end. But the life seems never want me to have a rest.    
>My course: Maybe this is the last year I will spend in university, so I choose 3 challenging courses: operating System, Computer Graphics and Big Data.   

>My off-campus task: many websites need me to construct and maintain.      

>Trying to find a job: prepare for coding interview, as most companies require Java skill, which is my weakness.     

The weird thing is that what I learn is very low level, but what I do for real life task is very high level. I could not explain that, and I just believe that if I understand low level better, then I can make high level more efficient.      


At last, I always believe that with more power, it comes more responsibilities. And I must be strong enough to implement my dream.
