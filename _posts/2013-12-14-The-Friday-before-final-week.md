OK! I should say that it is not my luck day today.    

1. At 4pm, after a rush help for other's Database design, I got to Union Station for my bus to Boston.    
2. When I get Boston @ 5:30pm, yeah, I find that I have 5 dollars, so that I can buy my subway ticket without asking help from others like last time.   
3. OK, here comes the worst issue, the Google map navigated me to the opposite direction.     
4. At 6:30pm, I take subway again to go to my destination. And at 7pm, I get there.   
5. OK, someone is giving presentation there, but I have 30 minutes when I return to South Station.    
6. After having a talk with a team, bad, it is 7:45pm, but my bus is 8:00.    
7. I ask help for take me to bus station, Ohhhhh, traffic jam!!!!    
8. I missed my bus successsfully, after a rush running.    
9. Finally, I bought one train ticket.  Wow, everything is good, the train is with more space, and you can walk around if you like. And even I have a talk with some guy, who is travelling around.  But, it cost me too long time. 
10. When I get back to Worcester, it is 10:15. Then I walk to my school to warm me up. 
11. Thanks for Bin's chicken nuggets.
