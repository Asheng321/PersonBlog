It is raining today, and I got up pretty late.     
At 2:00PM, I went to buy gloves, then I made an one-minute-call to a girl. It is amazing, as it is one-minute-long. Even I ended it roughly, as I didn't know what to say next.

At last, as schedule, I will celebrate thanksgiving with my friends tomorrow evening, so I also buy some food for that with friend.
